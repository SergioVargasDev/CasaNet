# CasaNet: Smart Home Energy Management for Sustainable Living

CasaNet addresses the critical global issue of greenhouse gas emissions from energy usage, which constitutes about 70% of the global total, with energy generation and heat supply contributing significantly. This IoT-based project is designed to enhance energy efficiency in residential settings without compromising comfort, providing a cost-effective solution aligned with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 for Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Project Highlights:

* Energy Efficiency: Utilizes a photoresistor to detect light meter flashes, allowing for precise monitoring of energy usage in kWh and its associated costs, thereby improving the use of non-renewable resources in homes.
* Technological Integration: Combines the power of NodeMCU with ESP8266, a photoresistor sensor, and Firebase for data storage, with a user-friendly interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for intuitive data visualization.
* Innovation and Sustainability: The project incorporates advanced IoT, machine learning, and OpenAI technologies to not only enhance energy efficiency but also to promote a cultural shift towards environmental awareness, contributing to the creation of secure, resilient, and sustainable communities.

## Outcome:

CasaNet successfully demonstrates the potential of connected networks based on inhabitant behavior to optimize household energy needs, enhancing safety, efficiency, and comfort. The system provides real-time accurate measurements of electrical consumption, effectively connects the photoresistor sensor with the microcontroller for flash counting, and accurately calculates real-time energy costs, showcasing the precision of sensors and the synchronization of flash counting with real-time electrical activity.
