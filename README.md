# CasaNet: Smart Home Energy Management for Sustainable Living

CasaNet addresses the critical global issue of greenhouse gas emissions from energy usage, which constitutes about 70% of the global total, with energy generation and heat supply contributing significantly. This IoT-based project is designed to enhance energy efficiency in residential settings without compromising comfort, providing a cost-effective solution aligned with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 for Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Techonological Integration:

* Combines the capabilities of Arduino and NodeMCU with ESP8266 for robust signal processing, offering a powerful foundation for the IoT functionalities of CasaNet.
* Employs a photoresistor sensor for capturing light meter flashes, translating these into accurate real-time measurements of energy usage in kWh and providing insights into associated costs.
*Utilizes Firebase for secure, scalable data storage, ensuring that all energy consumption data is systematically organized, easily accessible, and reliable.
*Develops a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, facilitating intuitive interaction and data visualization. This approach ensures seamless user experiences across both web and mobile platforms, making energy management accessible to all.

## Objective & Hypothesis:

Our goal is to optimize household electrical consumption using IoT, aiming to improve energy efficiency, security, and comfort without impinging on user convenience. We hypothesize that a successfully implemented connected network, tailored to occupants' behavior, will significantly optimize household energy needs.

## Sustainability & Innovation:

CasaNet emphasizes energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the goal of creating sustainable cities. The project's innovative edge comes from integrating advanced technologies like IoT, machine learning, and OpenAI, adding sophistication and intelligence to the system.
